# Active Directory Lab

## Purpose? Goal?


## Introduction
* Chose not to mention every time a log out/in or a reboot was performed. Because that would be embarrassing.
* While there are many tutorials out there, the purpose of this is not to teach a step-by-step. The purpose is to document my labs in a higher-level way and illustrate some of the realities of working with technologies. More often than not, there is something invisible going on that you don't know about. This will continue to screw up your plans for success until you dig around enough to find it. Only then can you make things work. This to me is the most frustrating and rewarding aspect of working with technology. To pretend that it doesn't happen in a polished tutorial is nonsense, so I will be highlighting some of the problems that arose in each step.
